      <h1>Make-Ahead Frozen Yogurt Parfaits</h1>
      
      <p>
        There's nothing like a homemade frozen dessert after a long, hot, sunny
        day of cooking, playing, and possibly drinking outdoors. The problem
        with many of these desserts is that you need an ice cream machine to
        make them, as well as you have to figure out how to keep them frozen
        long enough to eat your fill of barbecued ribs and potato salad before
        you indulge. Well, this beautiful, fruity, frozen treat requires no
        mechanical assistance, and stays frozen in a cooler for a long, long
        time. And, even if it does thaw before you get to it, still makes for a
        wonderfully refreshing way to end your day. It's also relatively healthy
        compared to other similar desserts, especially if you layer your parfait
        with fresh fruit and granola. I loved how this came out, except for the
        fairly minor issue of me not loving frozen blueberries, but as I
        explained during the video, this is much more of a technique than a
        recipe, and you can layer your parfait with countless combinations of
        fruit, sauces, and crispy, crunchy bits. So, whip up a batch of the
        yogurt base, set out a variety of garnishes, and let everyone make their
        own. But no matter what you include in yours, I really do hope you give
        these a try soon.

        "Parfait" does mean "perfect" in French, which is very fitting, because
        these frozen yogurt parfaits are perfectly easy, and are a perfect
        make-ahead frozen summer treat.

          <li>1 cup blueberries, rinsed and drained.</li>
          <li>1 &frac12; cups granola.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Frozen Yogurt:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups full-fat plain Greek yogurt.</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>

          <li>&frac12; cup white sugar.</li>
        </ul>


      </div>

      
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>&#10003; Step 1</h3>
      <p>
        Combine raspberries and Â½ cup white sugar in a bowl. Crush with a potato masher into a puree. Cover and let sit out for 1 hour.
      </p>
      <h3>&#10003; Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Pass berry puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds. Add blueberries, stir, and keep in the refrigerator until needed.
      </p>
      <h3>&#10003; Step 3</h3>
      <p>
        Whisk yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and sugar for frozen yogurt together in a bowl until sugar dissolves and the mixture is light and fluffy. Transfer into a piping bag and refrigerate until needed.
      </p>

      
      <h3>To Build Parfaits:</h3>
      <h3>&#10003; Step 1</h3>
      <p>
        Add 2 tablespoons of granola into an 8-ounce jar, or similar vessel. Top with 2 tablespoons of the fruit mixture. Try to make sure some of the fruit sauce is touching the glass so you can see the layers when frozen. Top with 2 heaping tablespoons of the yogurt mixture. Repeat twice more for a total of 3 layers. Top can be garnished with any remaining fruit and sauce.
      </p>
      <h3>&#10003; Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Freeze until frozen solid, about 8 hours, or overnight.
